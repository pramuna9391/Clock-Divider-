# Clock-Divider
A clock divider is a digital circuit that reduces the frequency of a clock signal. It's commonly used in digital systems to generate slower clock signals from a faster one.

**Basic Concept:**
A clock divider divides the input clock frequency by an integer factor N.
If input frequency = f_in, and the divider divides by N,
then output frequency = f_out = f_in / N.
**How It Works:**
A simple counter is used to count clock cycles.
When the counter reaches a specific value (like N/2 or N), the output toggles, and the counter resets.
